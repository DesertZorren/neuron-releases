### Introduction

Welcome to the Synapse AI wallet app. ðŸ˜Š This is how you'll register your wallet and application against the servers to participate on the Synapse network. 

### A few things:

1. We're still operating on the Ropsten testnet on the Ethereum network until this is out of Alpha. You can help us bring it out of beta by joining up here: https://synapse.ai/developers -- We're also kicking around the idea of opening a separate channel for developers to communicate.

2. The wallet data is currently stored in `~/Library/Application\ Support/neuron-wallet` for mac OS.

3. Pre-registration is required on the tokensale website (https://tokensale.synapse.ai). 

4. We use your registration on the tokensale site to register your wallet. This synchronizes your account and software to our service, and allows us to disburse tokens to you.


### What's next

1. We have some awesome ideas in the works to create a whole new experience for everyone. We'll be innovating in this space for a while.

2. We're looking for devs to join the team. Drop us a line at dan [at] synapse [dot] ai
